# Game of life
Simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C.

The project is still WIP and the executable is just a hardcoded demo.
I also plan on optimising the algorithm. For now it only has basic
functionality.

I also plan on doing a GUI.

# Compiling and running

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rafaelrc7/game-of-life-c.git
cd game-of-life-c
make
./bin/game-of-life
```
